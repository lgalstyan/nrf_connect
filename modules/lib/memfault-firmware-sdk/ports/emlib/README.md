# Silicon Labs emlib Port

This port adds implementations for coredump storage, CLI, reboot reasons, and
watchdog features using the Gecko SDK/emblib.

## Compatibility

The port has been built against v3.0 of the Gecko SDK. The port has been built
and tested against v4.3.0 using SimplicityStudio.

## Features

The port provides the following features:

- Coredump storage using a linker-defined region in internal Flash
- Reboot reason implementation for collecting reboot events
- An integration with the Watchdog peripheral to capture watchdog-triggered
  traces
- A Gecko SDK compatible CLI to demo Memfault features

## Adding To Your Project

The simplest way to add this to your project is to do the following:

1. Add the source files in `ports/emblib` to your build system
2. Add the include directory at `ports/include`

## CLI Component

The CLI component requires building with SimplicityStudio for full
functionality. After adding the file as source to your project, you will need to
add the following snippets to your .slcp file:

```yaml
# In component section
component:
  - instance: [example]
    id: cli
```

```yaml
# In template_contribution
